# Weather Dashboard - Server API Challenge

## **Description**

This is the first project using server-side APIs and honestly it was a lot of fun. I was a lot more comfortable with the CSS/HTML and messing with all the data being pulled in was really cool to see and tinker with. I tried to make this one as close to the example image as possible so I could fully focus on the back-end work since I knew that would be the most trouble. Whatever city you type in will show up

## **Acceptance Criteria**
```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history
WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the humidity, and the wind speed
WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity
WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
